# Agent Guide

Start here when contributing to this repository with an AI coding agent. The rules live in the
same files that human contributors use:

- [`GUIDELINES.md`](GUIDELINES.md) — coding conventions, testing, linting and documentation.
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) — repository layout, design decisions and constraints.
- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) — contribution process, build and test commands, coverage
  gate, and commit and PR conventions.

## Build, test and review

Use the toolchain version in [`README.md`](README.md) and the commands in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md#a-typical-workflow). Review changed code against
`GUIDELINES.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` before submitting it.

For a local code-quality review, run `/code-quality` in Claude Code. Codex and other agents should
read and follow [the same procedure](.claude/skills/code-quality/SKILL.md) when asked to review
code quality. The procedure reads the documents above instead of defining another set of
conventions.

## Using the library

For agents integrating this library into another project, [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) is the discovery
entry point for packages, examples, API reference and audits.
